# warnings, but these are not important to the reason these examples exist.
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {wine glasses} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit 'glasses of wine' SHOULD contain the annotation (it does not)

# Informative valueSets that don't need OIDS
WARNING: Resource: This resource should have an OID assigned to cater for possible use with OID based terminology systems e.g. CDA usage (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)
