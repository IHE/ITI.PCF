Provided an [ITI-71](other.html#updates-to-iti-71) is requested prior to expiration, then the resulting token would be the same as [Basic Consent to sharing for Treatment policy](Consent-ex-consent-basic-treat.html#notes). If the request is after expiration then [ITI-71] responds with an error response as defined in the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework [OAuth 2.1, Section 5.2].
